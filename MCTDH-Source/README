 **** MCTDH code for implementing VHSTICKING adiabatic 2D/4D potential ****

 The files present in the current directory are needed for the 
 implementation of the VHSTICKING potential in Heidelberg's MCTDH package

 - vhsticking.f90 is the actual PES code while DEF_vhsticking.f is
   its dummy counterpart which is needed by MCTDH 

 - user_surfaces and user_surfdef are the MAKEFILE additions for 
   the compilation of MCTDH with vhsticking
 
 - user1d.F and usersrf.F are the modified MCTDH source files linking the 
   new subroutines defined by the user

 - test.f90 is a test code for running the subroutines in vhsticking.f90
   without MCTDH linking

 These subroutines define a 2D/4D potential for H sticking on graphite
 depending on xH,yH,zH and zC. This potential is defined starting from
 J.Kerwin and B.Jackson's potential energy surface (see reference 
 J.Phys.Chem B 2006, 110, 18811-18817). At each fixed 2D/4D geometry,
 the positions of the other carbon atoms are optimized to get the lowest
 energy with a mixed steepest descent / newton-raphson procedure.

 To install VHSTICKING in Heidelberg's MCTDH, perform the following actions:

 1) copy vhsticking.f90 and DEF_vhsticking.f in the directory 
    $MCTDH_DIR/mctdh85.3/source/surfaces/
 2) copy user_surfaces and user_surfdef in the directory 
    $MCTDH_DIR/mctdh85.3/install 
 3) cp user1d.F and usersrf.F in the directory 
    $MCTDH_DIR/mctdh85.3/source/opfuncs 
 4) compile MCTDH executables
    $! compile -a -x lapack -i vhsticking all

 WARNING: in steps 2) and 3) default files will be overwritten!
