# This file, user_surfaces, is included into the Makefile.
#
# Add here new potential energy surfaces. If a PES depends on include or
# other files, this dependency must be accounted for here! E.g.:
#
# newpes.o : $(PATH_SURFACES)/newpes.F   $(PATH_INC)/paths.inc
#	  $(FC) $(FFLAGS) -c -o $@ $(PATH_SURFACES)/newpes.F
#
# In general, a simpler form is sufficient:
#
# newpes.o : $(PATH_SURFACES)/newpes.f
#	  $(FC) $(FFLAGS) -c -o $@ $?
#
# Note that the second line MUST start with a TAP and not with a series
# of blanks!
#
# Do not forget to include the corresponding default PES (DEF_...)
# in file install/user_surfdef and in the source/surfaces directory.
#
vhsticking.o : $(PATH_SURFACES)/vhsticking.f90
	$(FC) $(FFLAGS) -c -o $@ $?
