# INPUT FILE for JK6_v2

# the code is capable of running different kind of simulation, as 
# defined by the variable RunType. In detail:
# RunType 1 -> scattering calculation, in which the initial conditions of H
#              are fixed by input, while the C configurations are randomly sampled
# RunType 2 -> equilibrium simulation, in which all the initial conditions are 
#              randomly sampled

# different level of output is possible, and is defined by the variable PrintType
# PrintType 1 -> minimal output 
# PrintType 2 -> full output, including trajectories XYZ files
