# INPUT FILE for JK6_v2

# the code is capable of running different kind of simulation, as 
# defined by the variable RunType. In detail:
# RunType 1  -> scattering calculation, in which the initial conditions of H
#               are set from input, while the C configurations are randomly sampled
# RunType 2  -> equilibrium simulation, in which all the initial conditions are randomly sampled
# RunType 3  -> test the parameters with a ND harmonic langevin model, equilibrium simulation
# RunType 4  -> equilibrium simulation, with harmonic oscillator bath and given spectral density
# RunType 10 -> Print cuts of the H-graphite potential

# different level of output is possible, and is defined by the variable PrintType
# PrintType 1 -> minimal output 
# PrintType 2 -> full output, including trajectories XYZ files 
# PrintType 3 -> debug output, including time resolved info on each trajectory 
# PrintType 4 -> equilibration debug, computing average temperature over time
